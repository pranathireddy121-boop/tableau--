his repository contains two Tableau data visualization projects:

Titanic Dataset Visualization Coffee Chain Dataset Visualization Each project demonstrates practical data analysis and visualization using Tableau’s key features such as heat maps, box plots, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and interactive dashboards.

1️⃣ TITANIC DATASET VISUALIZATION 📘 Dataset Description: The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers on the RMS Titanic, including age, gender, class, fare, and survival status. This visualization explores survival trends and demographic relationships using Tableau.

🧭 Steps Performed: Bar Chart: Passengers by Gender. Stacked Bar Chart: Survival count by Gender. Bar Chart: Survival rate by Passenger Class. Histogram: Age distribution of passengers. Scatter Plot: Age vs. Fare relationship. Box Plot: Fare distribution by Passenger Class. Heat Map: Survival rate by Gender and Class. Pie Chart: Gender distribution of passengers. Dashboard: Combined interactive view of all visuals for deeper insights.

🧩 Key Insights: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males. First-class passengers had better survival outcomes compared to other classes. Fare and Class were strongly correlated — higher fares were linked with higher survival chances. Most passengers were within the 20–40 years age range.

2️⃣ COFFEE CHAIN DATASET VISUALIZATION 📘 Dataset Description: The Coffee Chain dataset contains sales, profit, marketing, and budget information for a retail coffee business across different states and markets. The goal is to analyze business performance and identify high and low profit areas.

🧭 Instructions & Tasks Performed: (i) Heat Map — Product Type, State, and Profit Created to visualize profit distribution across different states and product types. Identified states with lowest profit for each product category.

(ii) Box Plot — Espresso Sales Distribution Visualized sales spread for Espresso products to identify variability.

(iii) Bar Chart — Product Type, Product, and Profit Compared profit contributions by product and category.

(iv) Scatter Plot — State, Sales, and Profit Displayed relationship between sales and profit to find states with high sales but low profit.

(v) Identify Highest & Lowest Profit State Ranked all states to highlight top-performing and underperforming ones.

(vi) Sales in Nevada for Decaf Espresso Filtered for State = Nevada and Product = Decaf Espresso to view total sales.

(vii) Contribution of Tea to Overall Profit (%) Calculated the percentage contribution of Tea products to total profit.

(viii) Average Marketing in Area Codes 660 and 818 Compared average marketing spend in selected area codes.

(ix) Highest & Lowest Profit Product in California Analyzed profit performance for products within California.

(x) Side-by-Side Circles — Minimum Marketing for Coffee Beans (Colombian) Visualized marketing levels for Colombian Coffee Beans across markets.

(xi) Contribution of Sales in East Market for Decaf Computed % share of Decaf sales in the East Market.

(xii) Contribution of Decaf Sales in East Market (2012) Filtered for Year = 2012 to identify yearly performance.

(xiii) Average Profit for Products Starting with “C” Filtered products starting with “C” and calculated their average profit.

(xiv) Central Region — Top 5 Products by Sales Identified and compared Top 5 selling products in the Central region.

(xv) 2013 — Highest Profit State in West Market Filtered for Year = 2013 and Market = West to find the most profitable state.

(xvi) Total Expenses-to-Sales Ratio of State with Lowest Profit Created a calculated field to evaluate cost efficiency of low-performing states.

(xvii) Distinct Count of Area Codes — Lowest Budget Margin, Small Markets Identified number of distinct area codes for small markets with the lowest margins.

(xviii) 2013 — % of Profit for Caffe Mocha (Major Market) Filtered Year = 2013, Product = Caffe Mocha, Market = Major to compute contribution.

(xix) Month-Year when Decaf Sales Crossed $1,100 (Colorado & Florida) Identified month-year combinations where Decaf sales exceeded $1,100 in Colorado & Florida.

(xx) Tree Map — Market by Budget Sales Created a tree map to identify the market with maximum budget sales.

🧩 Key Insights: Espresso showed lowest profit in several western states. Caffe Mocha and Colombian Coffee Beans were top profit generators. Central region’s top 5 products contributed over 70% of total sales. California had the highest sales and profit performance overall. Clear visualization of profit trends enables better marketing and inventory strategies. 🛠️ Tools Used Software: Tableau Public / Tableau Desktop Data Sources: Titanic.csv Coffee Chain.xlsx
